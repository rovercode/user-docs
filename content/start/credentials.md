Now that we've registered your Rover online, we need to download a file onto your thumbdrive to tell the Rover about its identity and how to get on your WiFi.

1. Click **Download Credentials**.
   ![Download Credentials](/images/register/DownloadRoverSettings.png "Download credentials")

1. Enter your local Wi-Fi credential so it will be loaded onto your rover. Then click **Download**.
   ![Enter Wi-Fi Credentials](/images/register/WiFiCredentials.png "Wi-Fi credentials")

1. The credentials will download to a `rovercode_*.env` file. Copy this file to your Rovercode thumb drive.
   ![The .env file should be in your Downloads directory](/images/register/EnvFileDownloaded.png "Downloaded .env file")
