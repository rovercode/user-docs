Your Rover runs on a battery just like one that you'd use to charge your phone.
Pull the battery and its USB cable out of its packaging.

1. Place the battery on the chassis near the front of the rover.

1. Use the fuzzy pipe cleaners to hold the battery in place. Twist the pipe cleaners tight until the battery doesn't slide out when tipped sideways. Try to make sure the battery doesn't rub on the wheels.

1. Take the USB cable and connect the large end to the battery. The small (micro USB) end will connect to the Raspberry Pi later.
