Now let's write your first code!

1. Find a number in your Vanguard Dance code, and change it. If it's `100`, maybe try making it `50`. If it's `20`, maybe try making it `90`.

1. Can you guess how this will change how the Rover moves?

1. Press the "Play" arrow again. Can you tell what effect your change had?

1. Right-click on a block near where you made your change, and choose **Add Comment**. Write a note about what change you made, and what it did to how the Rover moves.

Did any of your friends' changes make their Rover do something really cool?
Go back to the **Programs** tab, and search for a "Vanguard Dance" with their username.
You can remix it and run it on your Rover!
