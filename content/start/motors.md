The first things we will assemble are the motors.

1. Use the metal screws and nuts on the motors to attach to the chassis. Also use the #1 Phillips bit in the screw driver.

1. Connect the first motor to the chassis using the screws and nuts. Hold the nut tight with your fingers while you tighten the screw with the screw driver. The wires should point towards the middle of the rover.

1. Attach the second motor to the rover. Its wires should also point towards the middle of the rover.
