The first things we will assemble are the motors.

1. Look toward the skinny part of the Rover chassis for metal screws and nuts. These are for attaching the motor. Also, pull out your screwdriver, unscrew the cap, and find the #1 Phillips bit in the screw driver.

1. Connect the first motor to the chassis using the screws and nuts. Hold the nut tight with your fingers while you tighten the screw with the screw driver. The wires should point towards the middle of the rover.

1. Attach the second motor to the rover. Its wires should also point towards the middle of the rover.

1. Push the wheels onto the motors. The _arrows_ of the treads should point towards the front as shown.
