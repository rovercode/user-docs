Let's connect all the pieces to the chassis to build your rover.

![Staring point of the rovercode chassis]("Chassis from box UPDATE ME with new chassis starting point")

1. Use the metal screws and nuts on the motors to attach to the chassis. Also use the #1 Phillips bit in the screw driver.

1. Connect the first motor to the chassis using the screws and nuts. Hold the nut tight with your fingers while you tighten the screw with the screw driver. The wires should point towards the middle of the rover.

1. Attach the second motor to the rover. Its wires should also point towards the middle of the rover.

1. Push the wheels onto the motors. The _arrows_ of the treads should point towards the front as shown.

1. Use the larger, white nylon screws and the #1 Phillips bit in the screw driver to attached the Ultrasonic Rangers.

1. Connect the first ultrasonic ranger to the standoffs using the 3 nylon screws.

1. Connect the second ultrasonic ranger to the standoffs using the 3 nylon screws.

1. Use the tiny, black nylon screws and the #0 Phillips bit in the screw driver to attach the LEDs to the rover.

1. Attach the first LED to the standoffs using 2 black screws. There is a third mounting hole, but no screw goes in there or it would block the cable.

1. Connect the Grove cable labeled `LED` to the first LED's input.
   ![Connect the cable to the first LED]( "LED with cable UPDATE ME with photo of LED and cable")

1. Attach the second LED with 2 black screws and connect a 20 cm Grove cable to its input.
   ![Attach the second LED and its cable]( "Both LEDs UPDATE ME")

1. Connect the cable from the input of the second LED to the output of the first LED. This is called chaining.
   ![Connect the second LED input to the output of the first]( "LEDs chained UPDATE ME")

1. Place the battery on the chassis near the front of the rover.
   ![Place the battery on the chassis near the front]("Battery location UPDATE ME maybe just crop?")

1. Use the fuzzy pipe cleaners to hold the battery in place. Twist the pipe cleaners tight until the battery doesn't slide out when tipped sideways.

1. Route the power cable from the power bank under the cover and plug into the top of the Raspberry Pi.

1. Congratulations! Your rover is now assembled!
