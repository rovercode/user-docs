Let's connect all the pieces to the chassis to build your rover.

![Staring point of the rovercode chassis](/images/start/01_ChassisStartingPoint.jpg "Chassis from box")

1. Use the metal screws and nuts to connect the motors to the chassis. Also use the #1 Phillips bit in the screw driver.
![Use the metal screws and nuts for the motor](/images/start/02_MotorMountScrews.jpg "Motor mount screws")

1. Connect the first motor to the chassis using the screws and nuts. Hold the nut tight with your fingers while you tighten the screw with the screw driver. The wires should point towards the middle of the rover.
![Attach the first motor with the screws and nuts](/images/start/03_AttachFirstMotor.jpg "First motor attached")

1. Attach the second motor to the rover. Its wires should also point towards the middle of the rover.
![Attach the second motor with the screws and nuts](/images/start/04_AttachSecondMotor.jpg "Second motor attached")

1. Each motor will connect on its side of the rover. See how the cables do not cross each other.
![Route the motor cables as shown](/images/start/05_MotorCableRouting2.jpg "Motor cable routing")

1. Plug the motor cables into the motor driver. The connector only fits in the driver in one direction.
![Plug the motor cables into the motor driver](/images/start/06_MotorCableRouting.jpg "Motors plugged in to driver")

1. Using a 20 cm Grove cable, connect the motor driver board to the GrovePi+ port labeled `I2C - 1`. Use the rubber band from the cable to keep the cable organized.

1. Use the larger, white nylon screws and the #1 Phillips bit in the screw driver to attached the Ultrasonic Rangers.

1. Connect the 50 cm Grove cables to the ultrasonic rangers before attaching the screws.

1. Connect the first ultrasonic ranger to the standoffs using the 3 nylon screws.

1. Connect the second ultrasonic ranger to the standoffs using the 3 nylon screws.
![Connect the second ultrasonic ranger to the standoffs using the nylon screws](/images/start/11_UltrasonicSecond.jpg "Both ultrasonic rangers attached")

1. Connect the ultrasonic rangers to the GrovePi+ ports `D2` and `D3`. Each ranger connects to the port on _its_ side of the rover.

1. Use the tiny, black nylon screws and the #0 Phillips bit in the screw driver to attach the LEDs to the rover.
![Use the tiny, black nylon screws to attach the LEDs](/images/start/13_LedScrews.jpg "LED screws")

1. Attach the first LED to the standoffs using 2 black screws. There is a third mounting hole, but no screw goes in there or it would block the cable.
![Attach the first LED to the rover](/images/start/14_LedFirst.jpg "LED on rover")

1. Connect the 50 cm Grove cable to the first LED's input.
![Connect the cable to the first LED](/images/start/15_LedFirstCable.jpg "LED with cable")

1. Attach the second LED with 2 black screws and connect a 20 cm Grove cable to its input.
![Attach the second LED and its cable](/images/start/16_LedSecondCable.jpg "Both LEDs")

1. Connect the cable from the input of the second LED to the output of the first LED. This is called chaining.
![Connect the second LED input to the output of the first](/images/start/17_LedChainCable.jpg "LEDs chained")

1. Connect the first LED's cable to the GrovePi+ port `D4`.
![Connect the LED cable to the GrovePi+](/images/start/18_LedCable.jpg "LED cable connected to GrovePi+")

1. Insert 2 zip ties through the holes on the bottom of the rover to hold the cables in place.
![Insert the zip ties through the bottom to hold cables](/images/start/19_ZiptiesStarted.jpg "Zip ties through holes")

1. Route the zip ties over the top of the cables and down through the holes on the other side of the cables.
![Route the zip ties over top of the cables and down through the holes on the other side](/images/start/20_ZiptiesPlaced.jpg "Zip ties over cables")

1. The two ends of the zip ties should now be sticking through the bottom of the rover.
![The zip ties should be sticking through the bottom of the chassis](/images/start/21_ZiptiesUnderneath.jpg "Zip ties on the bottom")

1. Zip the zip ties to hold the cables in place.

1. Place the battery on the chassis near the front of the rover.
![Place the battery on the chassis near the front](/images/start/23_BatteryLocation.jpg "Battery location")

1. Use the fuzzy pipe cleaners to hold the battery in place. Twist the pipe cleaners tight until the battery doesn't slide out when tipped sideways.

1. Route the power cable from the power bank under the cover and plug into the top of the Raspberry Pi.
![Route the power cable under the cover along with the other cables](/images/start/25_PowerCable.jpg "Power cable routing")

1. Route all the cables down the side of the Raspberry Pi and out the bottom of the cover.

1. Use the tiny, white nylon screws and nuts and the #0 Phillips bit in the screw ddriver to attach the chassis cover. Hold the nuts with your fingers while you tighten the screw underneath.

1. Congratulations! Your rover is now assembled!
