Your Rover is powered by the same kind of battery you'd use to charge your phone.
It doesn't come with very much charge, so first thing let's get it charging.

1. Find your battery in its box.

1. Take out the battery and the USB cable.

1. Charge the battery by connecting the large end of the USB cable to your laptop and the small (micro-USB) end to the battery.
