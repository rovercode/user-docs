Only one person in your group need to register the Rover.
Now, let's share it with everyone in your group!

1. Make sure everyone in your group has logged in at [https://app.rovercode.com](https://app.rovercode.com).

1. Find your groupmate's usernames in the drop-down menu for sharing the Rover.
   ![Add your groupmates in the Rover sharing drop-down](/images/start/ShareRover.png "Sharing Rover drop-down")
   
1. After you've added everyone in your group, hit **Save**.
